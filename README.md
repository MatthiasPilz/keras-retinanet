# Keras RetinaNet

Keras implementation of RetinaNet object detection forked from [https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet] based on [Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002)
by Tsung-Yi Lin, Priya Goyal, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He and Piotr Dollár.

## Installation

1) Clone this repository.
2) Ensure numpy is installed using `pip install numpy --user`
3) In the repository, execute `pip install . --user`.
   Note that due to inconsistencies with how `tensorflow` should be installed,
   this package does not define a dependency on `tensorflow` as it will try to install that (which at least on Arch Linux results in an incorrect installation).
   Please make sure `tensorflow` is installed as per your systems requirements.
4) Alternatively, you can run the code directly from the cloned  repository, however you need to run `python setup.py build_ext --inplace` to compile Cython code first.
5) Optionally, install `pycocotools` if you want to train / test on the MS COCO dataset by running `pip install --user git+https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI`.

## Usage
### Converting a training model to inference model
The training procedure of `keras-retinanet` works with *training models*. These are stripped down versions compared to the *inference model* and only contains the layers necessary for training (regression and classification values). If you wish to do inference on a model (perform object detection on an image), you need to convert the trained model to an inference model. This is done as follows:

```shell
keras_retinanet/bin/convert_model.py /path/to/training/model.h5 /path/to/save/inference/model.h5
```

### Training
For training on [Pascal VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/), run:
```shell
keras_retinanet/bin/train.py pascal /path/to/VOCdevkit/VOC2007
```

For training on [MS COCO](http://cocodataset.org/#home), run:
```shell
keras_retinanet/bin/train.py coco /path/to/MS/COCO
```

For training on a custom dataset, a CSV file can be used as a way to pass the data.
See below for more details on the format of these CSV files.
To train using your CSV, run:
```shell
keras_retinanet/bin/train.py csv /path/to/csv/file/containing/annotations /path/to/csv/file/containing/classes
```

## CSV datasets
The `CSVGenerator` provides an easy way to define your own datasets.
It uses two CSV files: one file containing annotations and one file containing a class name to ID mapping.

### Annotations format
The CSV file with annotations should contain one annotation per line.
Images with multiple bounding boxes should use one row per bounding box.
Note that indexing for pixel values starts at 0.
The expected format of each line is:
```
path/to/image.jpg,x1,y1,x2,y2,class_name
```
By default the CSV generator will look for images relative to the directory of the annotations file.

Some images may not contain any labeled objects.
To add these images to the dataset as negative examples,
add an annotation where `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` and `class_name` are all empty:
```
path/to/image.jpg,,,,,
```

### Class mapping format
The class name to ID mapping file should contain one mapping per line.
Each line should use the following format:
```
class_name,id
```

Indexing for classes starts at 0.
Do not include a background class as it is implicit.

For example:
```
cow,0
cat,1
bird,2
```

## Debugging
Creating your own dataset does not always work out of the box. There is a [`debug.py`](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet/blob/master/keras_retinanet/bin/debug.py) tool to help find the most common mistakes.

Particularly helpful is the `--annotations` flag which displays your annotations on the images from your dataset. Annotations are colored in green when there are anchors available and colored in red when there are no anchors available. If an annotation doesn't have anchors available, it means it won't contribute to training. It is normal for a small amount of annotations to show up in red, but if most or all annotations are red there is cause for concern. The most common issues are that the annotations are too small or too oddly shaped (stretched out).
